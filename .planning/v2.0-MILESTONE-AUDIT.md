- SUMMARY.md files missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter field
- 3 items awaiting human browser verification (language detection, localStorage persistence, translation quality)

### Phase 5: SEO & Metadata
- 3 items awaiting human browser verification (language switcher navigation, smooth scroll, dark mode compatibility)
- English page uses Italian section IDs — deferred as ENH-03 in REQUIREMENTS.md
- `--color-text-secondary` CSS variable defined in global.css but unused by any selector
- Base.astro `description` prop has Italian hardcoded default (never triggered by current pages but latent risk)
